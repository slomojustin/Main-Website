# =============================================================================
# GitHub Pages deploy workflow — what each part does
# =============================================================================
#
# WHEN IT RUNS (trigger):
#   - On every push to the "main" branch. Change to "master" if that's your default.
#
# WHAT IT DOES (two jobs):
#   1. build: install deps, build the Vite app, upload the dist folder as an "artifact"
#   2. deploy: take that artifact and publish it to GitHub Pages
#
